# Desktop-App

This is the desktop app for decoding data received from the satellite at the ground station as well as testing receiving UART messages during testing in development. The software implemnts communication over the serial port using the [HLDLC protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control) as well as the [ECSS-E-70-41A protocol](https://ecss.nl/standard/ecss-e-70-41a-ground-systems-and-operations-telemetry-and-telecommand-packet-utilization/).
